# HiveSense

HiveSense is a HAF-based application designed to enable **semantic search** among posts
on the Hive blockchain. It leverages **machine learning embeddings** to provide a
powerful and efficient way to find related content based on meaning rather than exact
keywords. The system integrates with [**Hivemind**](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind), a structured SQL-based database
layer for Hive social media data, to collect root posts, compute embeddings, and store
them in a **PostgreSQL vector database**. Through a **REST API**, HiveSense allows
clients to search for posts similar to a given text or retrieve posts similar to a
specific existing post. This enhances content discovery and engagement within the Hive
ecosystem.
